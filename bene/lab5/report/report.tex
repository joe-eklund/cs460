\section{Experiments}

To demonstrate that our routing protocol implementation works as it should, we ran a series of routing tests. We built three different networks and outputed the distance vectors for each node as the forwarding tables were built. The three networks we used were as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item 5 nodes in a line
   \begin{lstlisting} 
n1--n2--n3--n4--n5
\end{lstlisting}

  \item 5 node in a ring
   \begin{lstlisting} 
        n3 
      /   \
    n2     n4
     |     |
    n1 --- n5
\end{lstlisting}

  \item 15 node mesh
  \begin{lstlisting} 
#       --- n7 --- n8
#      /    |       |
#    n9     |       |
#      \--- n6     n2 -- n14 -- n15
#            \    /  \   /
#             \  /    \ /
#      n10 --- n1     n3
#               |      |
#               |      |
#              n4 --- n5 -- n13
#               |      |
#               |      |
#              n11    n12
\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}
