# Latex Report Template

A simple template for a lab report using LaTeX. Ensure that you have
LaTeX installed:

```
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-recommended
```

This will install the most commonly used packages, and then you can
always install extra as needed. If you prefer the full version, yo
can use:


```
sudo apt-get install texlive-full
```

Once you have LaTeX installed, you can then make the report with:

```
pdflatex report.tex
```
